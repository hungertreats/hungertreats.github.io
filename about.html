	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Deepika Goyal and welcome to my food blog. Each week I try out a new recipe and post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post, I would be delighted to know. Feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<p>I live in Bussigny, Switzerland and love to cook. I have lived more than 20 years in India and love preparing Indian dishes. If you are around looking for authentic Indian cuisine, reach out to me or follow one of the recipes. </p>
