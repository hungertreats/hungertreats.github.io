  servings: 4
  prep: 15 minutes
  cook: 30 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 3 Large Potatoes, peeled
    * 1 tbsp Red Chilli Sauce
    * 1/2 cup Cornflour
    * Oil, to deep fry
    * 1 tbsp Olive Oil
    * 4-5 Dried Red Chillies
    * 1 tbsp White Sesame Seeds/Safed Til
    * 1 tbsp Crushed Garlic
    * 1/2 tsp Red Chilli Powder
    * 1 tbsp Dark Soy Sauce
    * 2 tbsp Vinegar
    * Salt as per taste
    * 1/2 cup Honey
    * 2-3 stalks Spring Onion Greens, roughly chopped
    * Coriander leaves, for garnishing
  directions_markdown: "1. Cut each potato in half the long way, lay the cut side
    flat on the cutting surface and cut into 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch slices. Stack these
    slices and cut into the same width sticks. Repeat with remaining potatoes.  \n2.
    After you are done with cutting the potatoes, soak them in warm water for around
    25-30 minutes.\n3. Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towel or a clean
    kitchen towel. Arrange them in a single layer to air-dry for a bit. The drier
    the better.\n3.  Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and add red chilli sauce,
    cornflour and salt and mix well. Make sure the potatoes are well coated with cornstarch
    as then only the potatoes will turn crispy.\n4. Heat oil in a frying pan and add
    the potatoes to it. Fry till the potatoes turn golden brown. (see notes)\n5. While
    the potatoes are frying, in another pan, heat olive oil and red chillies, sesame
    seeds and crushed garlic to it. The gas should be on low to medium flame.\n6.
    Once the garlic turns golden brown, add red chilli powder, soy sauce, vinegar
    and salt to it. Mix well and saut√© for a minute.\n7. Now add honey and mix well.
    Add the fried potatoes to the sauce and toss it well.\n8. Add spring onion greens
    and garnish with coriander leaves.\n9. Honey Chilli Potatoes are ready to be served."
  notes:
    title: 'Notes:'
    markdown: "* You can also use store bought parboiled french fries to save the
      soaking and cutting time of potatoes.\n*  To make the potato fries more crisper,
      instead of frying them completely at once, you can fry them in two stages. For
      this, after frying your fries first time for about a minute, shake off the excess
      oil, place them on tissue paper for about 5 minutes and fry them again until
      they turn golden brown. Once they're done, the outsides will retain a satisfying
      crunch, and the insides will be deliciously soft. \n* No matter how you serve,
      be sure to serve the fries while they're hot. Do not let the fries sit for too
      long as they will turn sticky in that case."
