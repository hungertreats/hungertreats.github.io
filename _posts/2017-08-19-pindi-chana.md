      * For a quicker version, you can use canned chickpeas as it will save soaking and boiling time.
      * If you do not have dry pomegranate seeds then you can also use tamarind paste. In this case, add the tamarind paste in step 8 after adding tomato pure√©.
      * You can increase or decrease the chilli powder content as per your taste.
      * If the chole masala is made in excess then you can preserve it for a couple of months. Put it in an air tight container and keep in your refrigerator.
