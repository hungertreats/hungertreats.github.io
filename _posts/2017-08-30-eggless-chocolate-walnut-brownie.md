    1. Mix the milk with vinegar and keep aside. Instead of using the milk+vinegar mixture, you can also use buttermilk here.
    2. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, soda, cocoa powder and salt.   Mix well and add the powdered sugar to this and stir well to combine.
    3. Add oil and vanilla to the milk + vinegar mixture that's been set aside.
    4. Now add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently fold to combine until there are no more streaks of flour left.  Do ensure that there are no lumps in the batter. Your batter should be of pouring consistency.
    5. Transfer the batter to a greased baking tray and add chopped walnuts on top. You can also add the walnuts to the batter if you want.
    6. Bake in a preheated oven at 350F / 180C for about 25-30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the brownie comes out clean. But do check the brownies after 20 minutes because every oven is different.
    7. Let the brownies stay in the baking tray for 5-10 minutes to cool down completely before you cut into squares.

      or chocolate chips, chocolate chunks, pretty much anything you prefer to change
      up the flavor of the brownies. \n* You can also add a layer of chocolate ganache
      to make the brownies look richer."

My husband loves brownies no matter what texture or form they come in. So a few months ago, I tried making brownies at home and he just loved them and since then I often make these at home. Just add some chopped walnuts, throw in some chocolate chips, put a scoop of vanilla icecream on top and these eggless brownies are good to go!
