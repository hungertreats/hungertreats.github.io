recipe:
  servings: 24 cookies
  prep: 15 minutes
  cook: 14-15 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 80 grams or 1/3  cup Unsalted Butter
    * 125 grams or 1/2 cup Unsweetened Peanut Butter
    * 200 grams or 1 cup Castor Sugar
    * 165 grams or 1¬º cup All Purpose Flour
    * ¬Ω teaspoon Baking Powder
    * ¬º teaspoon Baking Soda
    * A pinch of salt
    * 1 cup Chocolate Chips (Optional)
  directions_markdown: "1. In a bowl, beat together sugar, butter and peanut butter
    with an electric beater until the mixture is fluffy and slightly pale in colour.
    You can also whisk the ingredients if you do not have an electric beater. \n2.
    In another bowl, sift all purpose flour, baking powder and baking soda and mix
    properly.\n3. Now add the butter and sugar mixture to the flour mix followed by
    chocolate chips.\n4. Mix properly and form a rough dough. Refrigerate the dough
    for minimum 15-20 minutes.\n5. Once the cookie dough is chilled, take about 1
    tablespoon of cookie dough and roll it in your palms and place it on very lightly
    greased cookie sheet.\n6. Roll rest of the dough in the same way. Keep some distance
    between the cookies as they will rise as they bake.\n7. After rolling the cookies,
    press them down with a fork, first vertically and then horizontally for a designed
    texture. If you want, you can also skip this step.\n7. Bake the cookies in a preheated
    oven at 180¬∞C for 14-15 minutes. If you like slightly crisper cookies, bake them
    for another 2 minutes. \n8. Once out of the oven, let the cookies cool down for
    5-7 minutes."
  notes:
    title: 'Notes:'
    markdown: "* Instead of completely using castor sugar, you can also use brown
      sugar in 1:1 ratio. \n* If you are using sweetened peanut butter then reduce
      the sugar content to 175 grams.\n* Skip adding salt if you are using salted
      butter."
