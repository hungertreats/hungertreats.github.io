  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Add quinoa and vegetable stock to a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until all liquid is absorbed and quinoa is fluffy - about 20 minutes.
    2.  Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl and add all the remaining ingredients - black beans through the salt. Mix well until all the ingredients are well combined.
    3. Now add cooked quinoa to the bowl in which the mixture was prepared in step 2. Mix well and taste the stuffing and then adjust the seasonings, if required, as per your taste.
    4. Line a baking tray/dish and lightly grease it oil or butter.
    5. Brush halved peppers with a high heat oil and stuff the peppers with quinoa mixture until all peppers are full, then cover the baking dish with foil.
    6. Bake the peppers in a preheated oven at 390F/200C for 30 minutes covered (Instead of this, you can also microwave the peppers for a few minutes to soften slightly). Then remove foil, increase heat to 428F/220C, and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until peppers are soft and slightly golden brown. For softer peppers, bake 5-10 minutes more.
    7. Serve with grated cheese on the top or as it is.

These stuffed peppers make a delicious meal with a tossed salad, or serve them along with mashed or baked potatoes. We enjoyed these recently for lunch, but they could really be great for any time of the day! They are entertaining for everyone, since they‚Äôre so filling and flavorful. And you know they‚Äôre good when they‚Äôre hungry-husband approved!

The filling is so delicious ‚Äì loaded with black beans and quinoa cooked in vegetable stock, smoky spices and corn ‚Äì but it becomes even more delectable once its stuffed into sweet bell peppers and roasted to perfection. And to make them look more richer top them with some shredded cheese just before they come out of the oven and they are good to go.. Whoopy!!!!
