    1. In a large pan or kadhai, heat a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of oil.
    2. Add red chillies, ginger, garlic, and all the whole spices (bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and peppercorns). Saute for a minute or two and add green chillies, cashew nuts, and onions. Once the onions turn translucent, add the tomatoes. Mix well.

    4. Once the mixture cools down, grind the mixture to a smooth paste.
    5. In the same pan or kadhai, heat the remaining butter and add the gravy paste made in step 4.
    6. Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, cumin and coriander powder. Mix well.
    7. Now add garam masala, sugar and salt along with 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk. Bring the gravy to a boil.
    8. Once the gravy comes to a boil, simmer and cook for 4-5 minutes, till the oil separates slightly.
    9. Now, Gently add paneer cubes to the gravy and mix well. Add crushed kasoori methi and cook for approx 2 minutes or until you get the desired consistency.
    9.  Add fresh cream, mix properly and switch off the flame.

      * Add 1/2 cup  water in step 8 and cook for 3-4 minutes if the gravy is too thick.
      * If you like creamier gravy, then add more cream in step 9. Alternatively, if you do not like creamy taste, then you can altogether avoid using cream.
