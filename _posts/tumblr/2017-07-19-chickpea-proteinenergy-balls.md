    * **For Making Balls:**
     * 1.5 cups boiled chickpeas (You can also use canned chickpeas)
     * ⅓ cup vanilla protein powder
     * ¼ cup peanuts (lightly salted)
     * 4 tablespoons maple syrup
     * 1 tablespoon scraped coconut
     * ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
     * ¼ teaspoon salt
     * ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
     * 15 almonds
     * 1/3 cup gluten free old fashioned oats
    * ** For Chocolate Coating (Optional): **

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Line a baking tray with foil.
    2. In the bowl of a food processor, add chickpeas, protein powder, peanuts, maple syrup, vanilla extract, oats, almonds, salt, and cinnamon. 3. Pulse to combine until all ingredients are mixed together and smooth; stop to scrape the sides if needed. It should be like a soft dough texture.Roll the dough into small balls.
    4. Place each ball onto the foil and place the baking tray in the fridge. Keep them in the fridge for at least half an hour so the balls get firm or you can also eat them as it is.
    5. Now, if you want chocolate coating then in a small bowl, add melted butter.
    6. Slowly stir in the cocoa powder until there are no lumps.
    7. Add ½ tablespoon maple syrup and a pinch of salt; stir to combine.
    8. Coat the balls in chocolate and keep them in the fridge for 15 minutes.
    9. You can also simply coat the balls with scraped coconut if you do not like the taste of chocolate.
    10. Store these in an airtight container in the fridge.

Simple! Cheap! Delicious! Energy balls are one of our favorite snacks because they take minimal prep time and often no baking at all and are packed with a lot of protein, and are utterly delicious and filling. Enjoy them as an evening snack or post-workout!

You can coat them with melted chocolate, cocoa powder or simply scapped coconut.
