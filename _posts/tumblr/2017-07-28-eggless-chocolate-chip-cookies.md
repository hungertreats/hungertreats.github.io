  directions_markdown: |-
    1. In a bowl, beat butter and sugar together until creamy and fluffy, with a whisk/electric beater. Sieve the flour and salt and add it to the butter and sugar mixture. Add vanilla essence and give it a quick stir.
    2. Add corn flour and combine to form a soft dough. If it doesn’t come together add a few drops of water/milk. Finally, fold the chocolate chips into the dough. Flatten the dough, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour.
    3. Preheat the oven at 180°C for 10 minutes.
    4. Divide the dough into equal sized balls. Roll each ball between the palms and shape it like a rough cookie. Place on an oven tray.
    5. Chill the cookies at this stage for 10 mins while the oven is preheating. Once the oven is preheated, bake the cookies at 180°C for 12-15 minutes or until the edges start turning golden brown. Cool down completely on a wire rack.
    6. The cookies may look soft but once they cool down to room temperature, they turn hard and crisp.
