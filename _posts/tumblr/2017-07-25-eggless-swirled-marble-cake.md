  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 Cup + 2 Tbsp Maida/All purpose flour
    * 1 Tsp Baking Powder
    * ½ Tsp Baking Soda
    * 1/3 Cup Vegetable or Olive Oil (You can also use melted unsalted butter.  I used a mixture of both)
    * ½ Cup Fresh Thick Curd
    * 1 Cup Powdered Sugar

    * 1 Tbsp Icing Sugar
    * 2 Tbsp Cocoa Powder
    * 2 Tbsp Water
    * Milk (If required)
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat oven at 180 degree Celsius.
    2. Sieve Maida, Baking Powder and Baking Soda in a bowl.
    3. In a separate bowl add Oil, Fresh Thick Curd and blend using a hand whisker till it becomes light.
    4. Add Powdered Sugar to it gradually mixing it in the oil-curd mixture.
    5. Add Vanilla Essence and mix well.
    6. Now add the flour mixture to it gradually mixing well to form a smooth batter. If the batter feels tight, add a little milk as required. Your batter should be of pouring consistency.
    7. In a separate bowl mix Icing Sugar, Cocoa Powder and Water and form a smooth paste.
    8. Now take greased cake pan and place a parchment paper at the bottom. Add half of the batter mixture and over it, add half of the cocoa paste. Make swirls into the batter using a knife or any other utensil. Ensure to dig deep in the batter so that swirls gets created deep inside the batter. Do not over do it - you just have to swirl once or twice.
    9. Add the remaining batter and over it add the cocoa paste. Make swirls again as per step 8 above.
    10. Bake the cake in a preheated oven at 180 degree Celsius for 20-25 min or till a toothpick comes clean.
    11. Unmould the cake and place it on a wire rack to cool completely.
    12. Cut cake into slices and serve!
