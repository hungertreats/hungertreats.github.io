An easy & delicious cake that never goes out of fashion. Loved the swirls!🍰Servings: Makes 7" loaf or 6" Square or round cakePreparation time: 20 MinutesBaking time: 20-25 MinutesINGREDIENTS:1 Cup + 2 Tbsp Maida1 Tsp Baking Powder½ Tsp Baking Soda1/3 Cup Oil (You can also use melted unsalted butter.  I used a mixture of both)½ Cup Fresh Thick Curd1 Cup Powdered Sugar1 Tsp Vanilla Essence1 Tbsp Icing Sugar2 Tbsp Cocoa Powder2 Tbsp WaterMilk (If required)METHOD:1) Sieve Maida, Baking Powder and Baking Soda in a bowl.2) In a separate bowl add Oil, Fresh Thick Curd and blend using a hand whisker till it becomes light.3) Add Powdered Sugar to it gradually mixing it in the oil-curd mixture.4) Add Vanilla Essence and mix well.5) Now add the flour mixture to it gradually mixing well to form a smooth batter. If the batter feels tight, add a little milk as required. Your batter should be of pouring consistency.6) In a separate bowl mix Icing Sugar, Cocoa Powder and Water and form a smooth paste.7) Now take greased cake pan and place a parchment paper at the bottom. Add half of the batter mixture and over it add half of the cocoa paste. Make swirls into the batter using a knife or any other utensil.
