    1. In a big bowl add chickpea flour, semolina, asafoetida, salt and sugar. You can store this mix in an airtight container and when ready, mix in the remaining ingredients.
    2. Add oil and citric acid. Add water and mix until well blended.
    3. Beat the dhokla batter couple of times to incorporate air into it. This will result into fluffy and light dhokla. This has to be done before adding eno.
    4. Finally, add eno and whisk the batter until it is well blended. The batter will become airy and frothy and it should be of a thick dropping consistency.
    5. Grease a pan in which khaman will be steamed. Pan should almost be double in size as the batter will rise up while steaming. In a large vessel fill water and lay a channi/strainer at the base. Pour batter into that greased pan and place it inside the vessel containing hot boiling water and over the strainer.
    6. Cover it with a lid and steam khaman for about 15- 20 minutes. **OR**
    7. If you are making the dhokla in the microwave then pour the batter into a greased microwave bowl. Cook for 3-4 minutes (or it may take 5-6 minutes depending on the microwave) at full power.
    8. Once it is steamed or microwaved, insert a toothpick to check if khaman is properly cooked. It should come out clean.
    9. Allow it to cool down for 30 minutes. Insert a knife around the edges to loosen up Khaman.
    10. Flip it over onto a plate.Cut into squares and prepare tempering.
    11. For tempering, in a pan,  heat oil, add mustard seeds, sesame seeds and green chillies and let it splutter on a low flame. Don’t fry these on a high flame as they may explode leaving a mess. Add curry leaves and when they are crisp, add sugar and water. Mix it well.
    12. Pour this hot mixture over steamed khaman. 
    13. Garnish it with coconut, coriander leaves and sev and enjoy this delicious and nutritious Gujarati snack with chutney of your choice.
