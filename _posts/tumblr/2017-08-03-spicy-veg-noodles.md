Perfect dinner idea for busy week nights. As with any fried noodles recipe, this one too has to be prepared on a high flame that lends a smoky aroma. A heavy bottom pan, cast iron skillet or a kadai or a wok will work very well for this.



Here is the complete recipe:

INGREDIENTS:
* 150 to 200 grams noodles of your choice
* 1 medium to large julienned carrot
* 2 to 3 medium julienned onions
* 8 to 10 finely chopped or thinly sliced french beans
* 1 small to medium julienned capsicum
* 6 cloves of garlic
* 1 tsp finely chopped/grated ginger
* A fistful of spring onion greens (For garnish)
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce or as required
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 tablespoon balck pepper powder
* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 1 tsp schezwan sauce
* 1 tsp red chilli sauce
* 1 tsp green chilli sauce
* Salt as per taste

METHOD:
1. For cooking noodles, heat enough water in a pan with salt and few drops of oil.
2. When the water comes to a boil, add the noodles.
3. Stir and allow to cook the noodles till they are just cooked or al dente. Don’t overcook the noodles.
4. Once the noodles are cooked, drain them in a sieve and rinse them in chilled water and keep aside.
5. Now, heat oil in a wok or pan.
6. Add garlic and stir fry on medium flame for some seconds. Then, add ginger and stir fry again on medium flame for 2-3 seconds.
7. Increase the flame to high and Onions, Capsicum and Carrots and French Beans.
8. Keep on stirring continuously while adding the vegetables.
9. Continue to toss and stir fry on a high flame till the veggies are almost cooked. Don’t overcook the veggies.
10. You can also decrease the flame if the heat becomes too much too handle and then stir fry the veggies on a medium flame.
11. Add soy sauce, red chilli sauce, green chilli sauce and schezwan sauce, vinegar, salt and black pepper and stir and then add the noodles.
12. Keep on tossing and stirring till the veggies are mixed well with the noodles for minute or two. switch off the fire.
13. Check the taste and add more salt, black pepper or any of the sauce if required.
14. Garnish with spring onion greens and serve hot!

Notes:
* You can also add cabbage or any other vegetable of your choice.
* You can increase or decrease the quantity of sauces as per your taste.
* If you want to make it a protein packed food, you can add some soya chunks. For this, soak the soya chunks in hot water for 15-20 minutes. Squeeze out the water from them and then add them with noodles after cooking the vegetables.

Happy Cooking! :)
