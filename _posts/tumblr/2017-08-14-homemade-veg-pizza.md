    **For making pizza dough**
    1. In a large mixing bowl, take warm water, sugar and yeast and give a quick mix until sugar gets completly dissolved.
    2. Let the mixture stand until yeast begins to foam vigorously (5 ‚Äì 10 minutes).
    3. Now add all purpose flour, salt and olive oil.
    4. Knead the dough adding water as required. The dough should be smooth and soft and not too sticky.
    5. Cover the dough with a wet cloth in a warm place for atleast 2 hours.
    6. After two hours, punch the dough with fist to release down the air. Again, allow it to rest for maxiumum 5 minutes.
    7. Dough for pizza is ready.

    **For making pizza sauce**
    1. In a pan, boil water and add tomatoes (slitted x on the bottom). Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for 3-4 minutes or till the skin starts to leave from tomatoes.
    2. Peel the skin of the tomatoes once they are blanched and cooled completely.
    3. Take 3 peeled tomatoes and blend to smooth puree.
    4. Chop other 3 tomatoes discarding the seeds. Transfer to the plate and keep aside.
    5. Now, heat oil in a pan. Add chopped garlic and saute till they turn slightly golden brown.
    6. Add chopped onions and saute them till they change colour.
    7. Add chopped tomatoes and prepared tomato puree and cook completely.
    8. Add basil, sugar, red chilli powder, oregano, chilli flakes and salt. Mix well and get the sauce to a boil.
    9. Cover and simmer the sauce for atleast 5 minutes or till the sauce turns thick.
    10. Add tomato ketchup and butter.Mix it well and cook for another 7-8 seconds. Pizza sauce is ready.

    **For baking pizza**
    1. Divide the dough into 2 balls and tuck them.
    2. Place one dough ball on dusted pizza plate or tray.
    3. Flatten the dough ball by stretching with both hands.
    4. Leave a centimetre or more and create a dent. This helps the crust to fluff slightly.
    5. Then prick with centre of dough with the help of fork to prevent pizza base from fluffing up like chapati.
    6. Spread pizza sauce generously leaving the sides slightly.
    7. Add capsicum, onion or any other toppings of your choice.
    8. Spread generous amount of grated mozzarella cheese over the base and sprinkle italian seasonings.
    9. Bake in a preheated oven at 500 degrees fahrenheit or 260 degree celsius for about 12 - 15 minutes.
    10. Slice and serve veg pizza hot with chilli flakes and oregano on the top.
