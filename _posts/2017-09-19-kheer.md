  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Wash the rice thoroughly in chilled water for about 5 minutes and soak them in enough water for at least 25-30 minutes.
    2.  Meanwhile, soak the saffron strands in tbsp of milk and chop the dry fruits/nuts and keep them aside to be used later.  Adding the nuts is completely optional, you can skip it if you want.
    3. After the soaking time is over, drain the water from rice and again wash them in clean water for about a minute.
    4. Now in a heavy bottom pan, add milk and on a medium flame bring it to a boil.
    5. Once it starts boiling, add rice and stir well and simmer it on a low to medium flame for about 20-25 minutes or till the rice is tender and cooked perfectly.  Do stir it occasionally, usually every 5 minutes and make sure that either the rice or the milk is not sticking to the pan.
    6. For checking whether rice is cooked or not, pinch the rice grain, it will mash very quickly and when you take a spoonful of it and pour it back in the pan, the rice and milk will stay separate.
    7. Now add sugar and mix well.
    8. Add saffron and milk mixture, cardamom powder and half of the nuts and mix well and let it simmer for 7-8 minutes. Remaining nuts can be used for garnishing.
    9.  For checking the right consistency of kheer, take a ladleful of it and pour it back into the pan. This time, the rice and milk should not separate like earlier and they should fall together in the same flow. Once you get this consistency you can switch off the flame.

Chawal ki Kheer or Indian Rice Pudding is probably the most common dessert that’s made in every household in India. It is made with only three basic ingredients - rice, milk and sugar (although I used more than three, but those are only for flavor and completely optional) and if you are vegan, simply swap the regular milk with almond milk and it would taste just as good!

It can be served warm or you can let it cool down completely and keep in fridge to get it chilled. Some people prefer chilled and some prefer it hot straight from the pan. Either way, rice kheer is the delicious and an super easy indian dessert which you can make quickly with a very few ingredients. I used full fat milk for making the kheer as it will make the kheer more creamy and rich and I suggest that you should also do the same. For flavoring I used saffron strands here, but besides that you can also add a splash of rose water and kewra essence to make the kheer more flavorful. Rice kheer is the quintessential Indian dessert and it's what every Indian grew up eating! So whenever you cook any Indian meal don't forget to finish it off with this delicious kheer! :)
